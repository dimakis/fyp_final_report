I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Kieran Murphy, for your fantastic help and excellent guidance throughout this process. It's been
a pleasure working with you. I've learned an awful lot from you. This formatting is for you.\\
I would also like to thank Walid from UBIAI, without the generous student discount for the annotation software I would still 
be manually annotating documents now, and this would be a very short report.

Most of all I would like to thank my wife and kids for their support, inspiration and for putting up with me throughout this entire 
process. This report would be nonexistent without ye. This one's for you Becca.
