\noindent
Extraction of key information from financial documents is a tedious and error-prone process.
This process is critical for compliance reasons, so it must be performed in a competent manner, often at great expense.
\bigbreak
This project automates the parsing of expenditure documents (invoices etc.) using a machine learning pipeline. 
The pipeline contains advanced open-source models that have been fine-tuned specifically for this task. 
Extracted data is then fed into a novel system to allow for the viewing of both expenditure and revenue in near real-time.
\bigbreak
The system is an event-driven, microservice architecture utilizing both industry standard and bleeding-edge technologies. 
This allows for a highly scalable and fault-tolerant system, thanks to the use of Kubernetes, Apache Kafka and Debezium.
Debezium is an open-source CDC technology that tracks changes in a database. 
These changes are propagated to the next steps in the data flow, Kafka topics.
Other microservices can consume these changes and action upon the changed data. 
This allows for the further decoupling of the system as consumers/subscribers to the change stream can be
added or removed entirely without any downtime of the system.
