\section{Motivation}
The motivation for this project comes from a number of major pain points of mine, from my previous / side career as a bar owner and manager. \\ This project focuses on building a system for use by
bar / public houses (pubs) and as such a single bar entity will be referred to as a \emph{user} of the system.\\
There is also scope for this system to be altered slightly and to be used with any business which operates with a similar back-end structure.
In fact, as the system is currently implemented, it is possible to use components of the system, for any business
which receives invoices (more on this later).
% link to the being able to use the system for any business.
\bigbreak
Some of the most time-consuming and least valuable, from a time - reward perspective, are the back-end processes of running the business. Reward is defined here as the actions which result
in potential business growth. Time spent scanning invoices from suppliers, filling out income and expenditure spreadsheets and calculating gross and net figures (which will be referred to
as `\emph{group A}' activities). Whilst these processes are critical to a business' operation and regulatory compliance they do not do much for business growth.\\
On the other hand, time spent on sourcing new products / inventory, finding new / novel forms of entertainment, business promotion and customer engagement (which will be referred to as
`\emph{group B}' activities) are the catalysts which drive sales and business growth.\\
The ultimate aim of this project is to provide more time for group B growth activities and processes by automating the group A processes.
\bigbreak
I hypothesize that this should lead to a healthier and more innovative industry by virtue of the extra amount of time spent on group B activities. With implementation of this system,
barriers to entry should be broken down which should only help to increase innovation. This comes from the new entrants into the industry who may excel in group B processes but do not have
the knowledge, cannot afford to pay accountants or have the confidence in their ability to perform the group A processes at a satisfactory standard. If these processes are automated then
there should be fewer barriers of entry coupled with a reduction in accounting costs. \\
Furthermore, the implementation of this system should increase the quality of life of business owners who no longer have to carry out menial, manual data entry and monotonous, simple and
repetitive data manipulation.
\bigbreak
For this to be accomplished there is a list of
core and essential processes that need to be tackled. \\
These core processes fall into two broad categories, defined as:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Category One}: comes from the data collected from a sale of a user's product, i.e., a pub selling a beverage (Income).
	\item \textbf{Category Two}: stems from the data collected from a user's purchases in relation to inventory and other purchases needed for the running of the
	      business, i.e., a pub buying a crate of beer to be resold to a consumer or rent for premises etc. (Expenditure).
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Category One} core processes include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Keeping a record of all sale transactions that enter the system, sorted by user, which will allow for the processing of sales.
	\item The subsequent saving and updating of the transactional sales figures, i.e., gross, net and tax figures.
	\item The updating of the inventory levels of products per sale.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Category Two} core processes include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The scanning of supplier invoices and key information extraction from the invoices. This key information will be used to:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Update user's inventory levels as stock is invoiced / delivered.
		      \item Updating of cash flow levels to reflect the current available funds.
		      \item Updating of tax collected and tax due figures.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
This is quite a lengthy and complex list of processes to automate.
\bigbreak
There exists further motivation for this project. It is a purely personal reason, which is a massive interest in developing knowledge 
about the entire process of developing a deep learning system. From the dataset creation phase to the training, evaluation and inference phases. 
In essence the entire ML stack. Furthermore, this area of Data Science is the major point of focus for work completed in semester two, the second half of this project.\\
I will use this project as a vehicle to explore and test both industry standard and brand-new technologies with an emphasis on open-source tech.
This will stress test my knowledge of the
technologies and both allow me to see what I can implement along with being a showcase of my skills in the field to potential employers.
This system will be built with the primary target of having each component implemented in such a way as to ensure maximum efficiency is the 
front and center focus.
\section{Scope}
The scope of this project was highly ambitious. The project focuses on tackling both the Category One and Two processes, with
an eye on weeding out every potential pitfall as if this project is the prototype of a real world product.
\bigbreak
\textbf{Note:} The Category One processes have been implemented, are functional and are reported on in the first report.
These processes are mentioned briefly here, for the reader to get an understanding of the
system's goals end-to-end. This report will focus on the development carried out in the second phase of development (semester two)
namely the Category Two processes, which have a heavy Data Science focus.\footnote{For a more in depth look at how the Category One 
processes have been implemented please refer to section 2.1.2 \emph{Current Architecture} of the first report.}
\bigbreak
Given the time constraints and the complexity of the system in development
there are some non-core components that	have been omitted or mocked. There are also some
pivots that needed to be made in order to get a functional demo by the deadline. These are
documented here to allow the reader to know that these processes have been thought about thoroughly,
before the decision was made to continue as detailed. \\ These include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For the Category One processes, the users' sales transactions and details are faked / generated. This is done through the main entry API which has a \code{.../transactions/fake/create}
	      endpoint. There is no Point of Sale (PoS) till software created.
	      \bigbreak
	      \emph{To obtain transactional data into the system from real data a new API server would need to be
		      implemented to fetch data from popular PoS systems. This has not been implemented, although
		      preliminary research reveals that two leading PoS systems APIs, namely SquareUp\autocite{SquareSolutionsTools}
		      and Clover PoS \autocite{APIReferenceOverview} both have the necessary APIs available to
		      allow for the capturing of such data and the integration of it into the system is not considered difficult.}
	\item There is no GUI to interact with or view data from a user standpoint. This would involve creating a web app which would be used to view data from the system about a user. This
	      would include sales figures, inventory levels, cash flow levels and tax figures.
	      \bigbreak
	      \emph{Upon stating that,
		      it is possible to obtain data insights from the system via SQL calls to the database, including total expenditure,
		      tax expenditure (to be offset against future tax payments) and net goods amounts.\\
			  Furthermore, the implementation of a Grafana (an open-source visualisation tool) dashboard}
	\item There is one area to note here is that there is a possible discrepancy between newly ordered inventory invoiced and the product actually delivered
	      by a supplier to a business.\\
	      Sometimes products which have been ordered are not delivered, i.e., out of stock with supplier or damaged in transit.
	      \bigbreak
	      \emph{For a solid fix for this situation the system should utilize a way of comparing delivery dockets with invoices. This would ensure only as accurate data as
		      possible enter the system. However, these situations happen infrequently and for this project the potential discrepancy will be ignored with the invoice taken at
		      face value of goods delivered.}

	\item The initial design was to include and automate all the Category Two processes in the
	      system. The final implementation of the system does include the inventory, but due to the time-consuming nature of the post-processing of the
	      inventory data returned by the model, the decision was made to concentrate on saving the financial aspects
	      of the invoices (totals, tax, metadata etc.). This decision was made to allow the system to be used for the processing of invoice totals for
	      real world usage. The system has now been used to ready documents for a VAT return, with surprisingly accurate results.
	      (this is reported on in greater detail later)
	      % link to detail.
	\item Whilst trying to balance the goal of using open-source components with creating a system that performs as effectively as possible, some
	      design decisions were made to prioritize the accuracy of the system's performance at the expense of using only open source components.\\ 
		  Upon that being said, the system can be operated using only open source components.\\
	      The proprietary components and the open-source alternatives used in the deliverable are:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \textbf{AWS Textract}: This is a combined Text Localisation and OCR engine that delivers very accurate results. This project
		            utilizes the AWS Textract API to for both the Text Localisation and OCR
					\bigbreak
					\emph{The system is capable of using other OCR engines and is already configured to use PyTesseract. This is an open-source Text 
					Localisation and OCR engine, but the output results are not as accurate as AWS Textract. To allow for the best overall results, 
					the system leverages AWS Textract.\\ AWS provides a very reasonable free tier for use of Textract with 10,000 free requests per month.}
		      \item \textbf{AWS S3 Bucket Storage}: S3 Bucket Storage is a service that allows for the storage of files in a bucket. This is used to store the
		            invoices. 
					\bigbreak
					\emph{This can easily be replaced with local storage or any other storage service.}
	      \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Side Benefits}
\label{subsec:side_benefits}
There are many useful features which become available as a result of having all of this information available in one system. These insights come in the form of individual data per
business but also trends and such from the data aggregated from all users of the system. A brief example of some of these include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ability to query the financial and inventory figures. With a simple GUI the user can be served up current sales vs other time periods and many other powerful ways to gain insight into
	      the business with information already in the system.
	\item The ability to do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) and other data analytical activities which can provide the business owners with some new data driven insights about their business.
	      These insights would usually only be available to larger businesses with IT teams or businesses with owners who are data science savvy. Businesses with these characteristics in the
	      drinks' industry make up only a tiny fraction of the population based on my decade plus of experience within the industry in Ireland and around numerous European cities.
	\item An example of another insight that can be derived from the information in the system which is of value to external entities, given decent levels of adoption in the industry,
	      are live sales per product.
	      Having a multitude of different users in the system, the sale quantities of specific items can be accessed and / or extrapolated in real-time. This can provide some invaluable
	      data to brewers, of sales which could be utilized to precisely schedule production times and production quantities.
\end{itemize}

\section{Planning and Strategy}
% change to 
ClickUp \autocite{ClickUpOneApp} is used as the project management solution (more details in \Cref{chap:conclusion}: Conclusion).\\
As the project is split in two development cycles, the following is an architectural diagram
of the system in its entirety, Category One and Category Two processes inclusive.\\
The components implemented for each phase are clearly distinguished from each other by the vertical, double-red lines:
\begin{figure}[H]

	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node(P) {\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/archi_phase_1_&_2.png}};
		\tikzstyle{title} = [red]
		\node [title] at ($(P.north)+(-3,0.1)$) {(Semester One)};
		\node [title] at ($(P.north)+(5,0.1)$) {(Semester Two)};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption[System Architecture]{System Architecture}
	\label{fig:sys_archi}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Note:} The actual delivered architecture varies slightly from the one depicted in \Cref{fig:sys_archi}, only with regard to the Category Two section.
Details to follow in the Architecture chapter (\Cref{chap:architecture}).
The reason this diagram is included is that this is the architecture that would be used in the final product, and the optimal architecture. Owing to some
difficulties with the development tools (\Cref{sec:pivots}) the delivered architecture had to be slightly altered, as will be explained.
